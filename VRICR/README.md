# VRICRï¼š Variational Reasoning over Incomplete KGs Conversational Recommender
The source code for WSDM 2023 Paper "Variational Reasoning over Incomplete Knowledge Graphs for Conversational Recommendation"

## Overview
We propose Variational Reasoning over Incomplete KGs Conversational Recommender. Our key idea is to incorporate the large dialogue corpus naturally accompanied with CRSs to enhance the incomplete knowledge graphs; and adopt the variational Bayesian method to perform dynamic knowledge reasoning conditioned on the dialogue context. Specifically, we denote the dialogue-specific subgraphs of KGs as latent variables with categorical priors for adaptive knowledge graphs refactor. We propose a variational Bayesian method to approximate posterior distributions over dialogue-specific subgraphs, which not only leverages the dialogue corpus for restructuring missing entity relations but also dynamically selects knowledge based on the dialogue context.

## Saved Models
We have trained our model on two datasets and saved the parameters, all of which have been uploaded to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ys3lz0nlnobTPoWUqlsmiVOeiRKGMW3p?usp=sharing).

The downloaded ckpt files should be moved into `data/ckpt`.

## Quick-Start
We run all experiments and tune hyperparameters on a RTX3090 with 24GB memory, you can adjust `train_batch_size` and `test_batch_size` according to your GPU, and then the optimization hyperparameters also need to be tuned.
```
sh script/redial/redial_rec_pretrain.sh
sh script/redial/redial_rec_finetune.sh # remember to change --task_ID_for_pretrain and --last_ckpt_path_for_pretrain
sh script/redial/redial_conv.sh

sh script/tgredial/train/redial_rec_pretrain.sh
sh script/tgredial/tgredial_rec_finetune.sh # remember to change --task_ID_for_pretrain and --last_ckpt_path_for_pretrain
sh script/tgredial/tgredial_conv.sh 
```

You can also test the model has been saved by us.
```
sh script/redial/redial_rec_eval.sh
sh script/redial/redial_conv_eval.sh

sh script/tgredial/eval/tgredial_rec_eval.sh
sh script/tgredial/eval/tgredial_conv_eval.sh
```
